To connect Meteor Wallet on NEAR, you'll typically use the NEAR Wallet Selector library. This library helps integrate various NEAR wallets into your dApp, and Meteor Wallet is one of the supported wallets. The process involves adding the setupMeteorWallet module to the Wallet Selector configuration. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Install the necessary packages:
MÃ£

# Using Yarn
yarn add @near-wallet-selector/core @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui @near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet
# Using NPM
npm install @near-wallet-selector/core @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui @near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet
2. Import the necessary modules:
JavaScript

import { setupWalletSelector } from "@near-wallet-selector/core";
import { setupModal } from "@near-wallet-selector/modal-ui";
import { setupMeteorWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet";
3. Configure the Wallet Selector:
JavaScript

const selector = await setupWalletSelector({
  network: "testnet", // or your desired network
  modules: [
    setupModal(),
    setupMeteorWallet()
  ]
});
4. Connect the wallet (example using modal):
JavaScript

const connect = async () => {
  if (selector.wallet) {
    // Wallet already connected, no need to connect again
    return selector.wallet;
  }
  if (!selector.wallet) {
    await selector.signIn();
    return selector.wallet;
  }
};
5. Interact with the wallet:
JavaScript

const meteor = await selector.wallet("meteor-wallet");
const signedMessage = await meteor.signMessage(params);
Key points:
